\section{Introduction}
Living in the modern era of technology, the public have become more accustomed to accepting new and innovative ideas surrounding the digital world. With significant development during the last decade, more intelligent devices have been designed and released onto the consumer market. These devices have attempted to mimic and replicate human features in different ways. There are smart devices that can reply to a user with a human-like voice, or robots that have human-like face features or bodies. In the world nowadays it is unlikely to not come across some intelligent device that resembles a human in a certain way, however this essay will evaluate whether these devices are beneficial to society and should continue being designed, or if they can cause a negative effect on consumers and the public.
