\section{Introduction}
Living in the modern era of technology, the public have become more accustomed to accepting new and innovative ideas surrounding the digital world. With significant development during the last decade, many more intelligent devices with human features have been released onto the consumer market. For Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs), the global market has been predicted to grow from 2016 to 2024 at an annual rate of 32.8\% \cite{tmr2016market}. These devices are responsible for assisting people in everyday life and have been designed to replicate human features in different ways. In the world today, it is not unlikely to come across intelligent devices that resemble a human in a certain way; interactions between these devices and humans concern the entirety of our daily lives \cite{securityTech2022interactions}. However, this essay will evaluate whether these devices are beneficial to society and should continue being designed, or if they can cause a negative effect on consumers and the public.

\section{The Problem}
Like all technology in development, human-like devices have been designed to solve certain issues that occur within the world. It is a large area of development and research that includes a multitude of unique devices, embodying different human features, that could benefit society in different ways.\par
Robotics has seen great advancements in recent years leading to humanoid robots that share many characteristics with humans, such as bipedal movement and facial expressions. Social robotics focuses on the aim of designing such devices that make peopleâ€™s everyday lives easier through assistance \cite{wykowska2014social}, benefiting the public.\par
Smart devices are another example of intelligent devices with human features that are prevalent in society. These devices are designed to have a human voice that responds to the user after receiving oral commands, allowing for a hands-off approach when operating such device. The purpose of this technology is to provide easier methods for completing trivial daily tasks, such as playing music or finding information online.\par
As discussed, there are many intelligent devices that have been designed to have human-like features for different reasons, but regardless of the rationale there is always the same debate as to whether it is right to design such technology.
